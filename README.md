1. Factorial Program (Functions)

Purpose: 
This program calculates the factorial of a number using a user-defined function.

How it works:
- A function named "factorial(num)" is defined.
- The function uses a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to the given number.
- The final factorial value is returned by the function.
- The user enters a number as input.
- The program prints the factorial of the entered number.

2. Mathematical Operations Program (Modules)

Purpose:  
This program demonstrates the use of Python’s built-in "math" module to perform mathematical operations.

How it works:
- The "math" module is imported.
- The user enters a number.
- The program calculates and displays:
  - Square root using "math.sqrt()"
  - Natural logarithm using "math.log()"
  - Sine value using "math.sin()"
